        <p> 
            This elective is a continuation of the Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundamentals module. In Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundamentals, students are introduced to basic digital fabrication skills such as CAD, 3D printing, laser cutting and the arduino.

            In this elective, students continue on their digital fabrication journey, learning additional skills such as CNC machining, designing and fabricating custom circuit boards, applications programming and the Internet of Things. Students develop and enhance their knowledge of these skills through a range of weekly hands-on assignments and a final capstone project.
        </p>

        <h2>Website Info!!</h2>
        <p>As you can see above there are various tabs in the navigation bar! Documentations take you to the weekly topics I have learnt in this module. Projects take you to the assigments that I have been doing and it is where I apply the things I have learnt in this module. Lastly, the about page provide more details about me!</p>
