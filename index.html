        <h2>What is digital fabrications?</h2>
        <p> 
            Here at EP1000 students are introduced to design thinking concepts, which they will use to design some functional prototypes to meet certain user requirements. Fundamental digital fabrication skills and technologies such as computer-aided design, 2D and 3D modeling, mechanical & electronic design and programming skills are developed through a range of hands-on real world activities. Project management, web and version control techniques, which are important for project development, will also be imparted to students.
        </p>

        <h2>Website Info!!</h2>
        <p>As you can see above there are various tabs in the navigation bar! Documentations take you to the weekly topics I have learnt in this module. Projects take you to the assigments that I have been doing and it is where I apply the things I have learnt in this module. Lastly, the about page provide more details about me!</p>
